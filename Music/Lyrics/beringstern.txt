START AT BEAT 13 (BPM 110)
 
It's a wonderful town you belong in
It's a beautiful town where you make friends
Make good choices, it's what you did
That made this town Beringstern

That's what made this town Beringstern

Clouds drift low with tales untold,
Lantern lights and hearts of pure gold. 

From picking up trash to a magical quest,
It was really hard, but it was the best.
In Beringstern, that's where it all starts (In Beringstern!)

I-
Woke up to the sound of the sky so wide,
Beringstern is glowing, the magic won't hide.
people were screaming, but I was beaming
and I got the chance to be a hero! (A hero!)

And I carried on, through storm or sun,
The journey's long, but we've just begun.
Every friend, each path we've turned,
All the love in Beringstern.

All the love in Beringstern.

It's been really painful, going through all this
But at the end, it turned out it was worth it

Hey, it's not about me, now it's your turn!
Now it's up to you to be the one to save Beringstern.
